Last month, July 25 2019 to be precise, the third SIGIR Workshop On eCommerce took place in Paris, France. 
Several quite intersting ideas and topics were discussed. Below I'll try to share links to resources shared 
during the workshop as well as give and outline of the key ideas that were discussed during the event:

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Resource</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Workshop Official website</td>
      <td>https://sigir-ecom.github.io/</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
