Last month, July 25 2019 to be precise, the third SIGIR Workshop On eCommerce took place in Paris, France. 
Several quite intersting ideas and topics were discussed. Below I'll try to share links to resources shared 
during the workshop as well as give and outline of the key ideas that were discussed during the event:

## Observations

Unlike the main SIGIR conference in which recommendation was the predominant topic, SIGIR eCOM was more inclined towards the search component of e-commerce websites.  In particular, among the 24 accepted short and long papers there were 12 of them about search.

More than 58% of the papers are 6 pages or more long.

A wordcloud of the papers' keywords, shows that e-commerce is at the center of most of papers, which confirms a heathly correlation between the papers and the workshop. Beyond that, learning with its different flavors (deeplearning, reinforcement learning, machine learning) stands out. Search and search related keywords (e.g: retrieval, spell checking, query etc) are predominant as well.

## Deeper dive into the papers

As search is the predominant topic, we will start by making sense of the various ideas suggested to improve it.
