Last month, July 25 2019 to be precise, the third SIGIR Workshop On eCommerce took place in Paris, France. 
Several quite intersting ideas and topics were discussed. Below I'll try to share links to resources shared 
during the workshop as well as give and outline of the key ideas that were discussed during the event:

Unlike the main SIGIR conference in which recommendation was the predominant topic, SIGIR eCOM was more inclined towards the search component of e-commerce websites.  In particular, among the 24 accepted short and long papers there were 12 of them about search.

More than 58% of the papers are 6 pages or more long.
